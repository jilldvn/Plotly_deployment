# Plotly_deployment
Module 13

#### Purpose
This project is to create dynamic charts using JavaScript for Roza to identify her volunteers'sameples with the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. When Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel. 
<br> As shown below, the end result for Roza is that we have 3 dynamic charts available by filetering sample number to retrieve Top 10 bacteria found in the bar graph, with being able to differentiate clone cultural amounts in the bubble chart. Lastly we are also able to identify each volenteer's navel scrub freqeuncy.
